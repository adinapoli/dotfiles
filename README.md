An incomplete (but expanding selection) of my public dotfiles, managed using
GNU stow. See [this blog post](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) for details.

Currently includes:

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

- [Zsh](https://zsh.org) (Aliases only)
